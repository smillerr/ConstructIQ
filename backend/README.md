This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the backend for ConstructIQ.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.10.x

## Installation

Once you are inside the backend folder, run this command on a terminal.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies needed for running the backend

After that, on the same terminal, run this command:
